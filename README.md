# GIG Javascript Challenge 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Persisting Data

Data is persisted using LocalStorage.

## State

Redux.js is used to achieve a centralized, more predictable application state.

## Functionality

The application allows the user to add, edit and remove contacts.

## Form

The form for creating and editing contacts uses the module _**country-list**_ , to get a list of countries. Email validation is achieved through a regex pattern.
